# Codebook

This dataset contains the variables observed on accelerometer and gyroscope
contained in a Samsung Galaxy S II. Each subject was required to perform
different activities, for the data collection. The dataset presents the means
and standard variation of variables observed, as grouped by subject and activity
combination.

## Each subject activity pair reports

Each variable is present in X, Y and Z axis variations, with it's respective
means and standard deviations. The variables are:

- timeBodyAcceleration
- timeGravityAcceleration
- timeBodyAccelerationJerk
- timeBodyGyro
- timeBodyGyroJerk
- timeBodyAccelerationMagnitude
- timeGravityAccelerationMagnitude
- timeBodyAccelerationJerkMagnitude
- timeBodyGyroMagnitude
- timeBodyGyroJerkMagnitude
- frequencyBodyAcceleration
- frequencyBodyAccelerationJerk
- frequencyBodyGyro
- frequencyBodyAccelerationMagnitude
- frequencyBodyAccelerationJerkMagnitude
- frequencyBodyGyroMagnitude
- frequencyBodyGyroJerkMagnitude
